# This is a Draft

This post has `draft: true` in its frontmatter, so it won't appear in the public blog list.

You can view it by going to `/blog/drafts`.

This is useful for:
- Writing posts over time
- Getting feedback before publishing
- Testing new features

When you're ready to publish, just change `draft: true` to `draft: false` and push to GitHub!
